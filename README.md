## Licensing

The library is available under a dual licensing scheme Affero GPL/v3 and commercial. See [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for details.

## Cryptographic primitives

The library is based on:

- [CoverCrypt](https://github.com/Cosmian/cover_crypt) algorithm which allows
  creating ciphertexts for a set of attributes and issuing user keys with access
  policies over these attributes. `CoverCrypt` offers Post-Quantum resistance.

- [Findex](https://github.com/Cosmian/findex) which is a cryptographic protocol designed to securely make search queries on
  an untrusted cloud server. Thanks to its encrypted indexes, large databases can
  securely be outsourced without compromising usability.

- [FPE](https://github.com/Cosmian/cloudproof_rust/tree/main/crates/fpe) provides `Format Preserving Encryption` techniques for use in a zero-trust environment. These techniques are based on FPE-FF1 which is described in [NIST:800-38G](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/specialpublications/nist.sp.800-38g.pdf).

- [Anonymization](https://github.com/Cosmian/cloudproof_rust/tree/main/crates/anonymization): `Data anonymization` is the process of transforming data in such a way that it can no longer be used to identify individuals without the use of additional information. This is often done to protect the privacy of individuals whose data is being collected or processed.

- [KMS](https://github.com/Cosmian/kms): The repository offers an implementation of the **Key Management Services** (server + client) handling the life cycle of all the symmetric and asymmetric keys.

## Getting started

### CoverCrypt

CoverCrypt allows to decrypt data previously encrypted with one of our libraries (Java, Python, Rust…).

To get an example of how to use CoverCrypt, take a look at `test/cover_crypt/cover_crypt_test.dart`.

### Findex

Findex allows to do encrypted search queries on an encrypted index. To use Findex you need a driver which is able to store and update indexes (it could be SQLite, Redis, or any other storage method). You can find in `test/findex_redis_test.dart` and `test/findex_sqlite_test.dart` two example of implementation.

To search, you need:

1. copy/paste the following lines
2. replace `TODO_ReplaceThisByTheNameOfYourClassOrTheRawFunction` by the name of your class
3. implement `fetchEntries` and `fetchChains`

```dart
  static List<UidAndValue> fetchEntries(Uids uids) async {
    // Implement me!
  }

  static List<UidAndValue> fetchChains(Uids uids) async {
    // Implement me!
  }

  // --------------------------------------------------
  // Copy-paste code :AutoGeneratedImplementation
  // --------------------------------------------------
    static Future<Map<Keyword, Set<Location>>> search(Set<Keyword> keywords,
      {int findexHandle = -1}) async {
    return await Findex.search(keywords, findexHandle: findexHandle);
  }

  static int fetchEntriesCallback(
    Pointer<Uint8> outputEntryTableLinesPointer,
    Pointer<Uint32> outputEntryTableLinesLength,
    Pointer<Uint8> uidsPointer,
    int uidsNumber,
  ) {
    return Findex.wrapSyncFetchCallback(
      TODO_ReplaceThisByTheNameOfYourClassOrTheRawFunction.fetchEntries,
      outputEntryTableLinesPointer,
      outputEntryTableLinesLength,
      uidsPointer,
      uidsNumber,
    );
  }

  static int fetchChainsCallback(
    Pointer<Uint8> outputChainTableLinesPointer,
    Pointer<Uint32> outputChainTableLinesLength,
    Pointer<Uint8> uidsPointer,
    int uidsNumber,
  ) {
    return Findex.wrapSyncFetchCallback(
      TODO_ReplaceThisByTheNameOfYourClassOrTheRawFunction.fetchChains,
      outputChainTableLinesPointer,
      outputChainTableLinesLength,
      uidsPointer,
      uidsNumber,
    );
  }
```

To upsert, you need:

1. copy/paste the following lines
2. replace `TODO_ReplaceThisByTheNameOfYourClassOrTheRawFunction` by the name of your class
3. implement `fetchEntries`, `upsertEntries` and `insertChains`

```dart
  static List<UidAndValue> fetchEntries(Uids uids) async {
    // Implement me!
  }

  static List<UidAndValue> upsertEntries(UpsertData entries) {
    // Implement me!
  }

  static void insertChains(List<UidAndValue> chains) {
    // Implement me!
  }

  // --------------------------------------------------
  // Copy-paste code :AutoGeneratedImplementation
  // --------------------------------------------------

  static Future<Set<Keyword>> add(Map<IndexedValue, Set<Keyword>> additions,
      {int findexHandle = -1}) async {
    return Findex.add(additions, findexHandle: findexHandle);
  }

  static int upsertEntriesCallback(
    Pointer<Uint8> outputRejectedEntriesListPointer,
    Pointer<Uint32> outputRejectedEntriesListLength,
    Pointer<Uint8> oldValuesPointer,
    int oldValuesLength,
    Pointer<Uint8> newValuesPointer,
    int newValuesLength,
  ) {
    return Findex.wrapSyncUpsertEntriesCallback(
      TODO_ReplaceThisByTheNameOfYourClassOrTheRawFunction.upsertEntries,
      outputRejectedEntriesListPointer,
      outputRejectedEntriesListLength,
      oldValuesPointer,
      oldValuesLength,
      newValuesPointer,
      newValuesLength,
    );
  }

  static int insertChainsCallback(
    Pointer<Uint8> chainsListPointer,
    int chainsListLength,
  ) {
    return Findex.wrapSyncInsertChainsCallback(
      TODO_ReplaceThisByTheNameOfYourClassOrTheRawFunction.insertChains,
      chainsListPointer,
      chainsListLength,
    );
  }
```

Note that if you `search` and `add`, the two implementation can share the same callback for `fetchEntries`.

Note that if your callbacks are `async`, you can use `Findex.wrapAsyncFetchCallback`, `wrapAsyncUpsertEntriesCallback` and `wrapAsyncInsertChainsCallback`.

Note that the copy/paste code could be removed in a future version when Dart implements <https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/1482>.

## Installation

```bash
flutter pub get cloudproof
```

### Download required native libraries

The Cloudproof Flutter lib uses FFI to access functions of the following native cryptographic libraries:

- `CoverCrypt`
- `Findex`

Those libraries must be found in specific subfolders for Android, iOS and PC architectures.

- Android: in `android/src/main/jniLibs/` subfolders:
  - `arm64-v8a`
  - `armeabi-v7a`
  - `x86`
  - `x86_64`
- iOS: in `ios/` folder
- PC: in `resources/` folder

To download them, please run the following script that will fetch the releases in the public URL [package.cosmian.com](https://package.cosmian.com):
:

```bash
flutter pub get
python3 scripts/get_native_libraries.py
```

Otherwise, to build those libraries manually, please check the CoverCrypt and Findex projects on Github: their `build` directory contains instructions on how to build the native libraries for your system.

## Example

To run the example, you need a Redis server configured. Then, update `redisHost` and `redisPort` at the top of the `example/lib/findex_redis_implementation.dart` file.

## Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
flutter test
```

Some tests require a Redis database on localhost (default port).

You can run the benchmarks with:

```bash
dart benchmark/cloudproof_benchmark.dart
```

### WARNINGS

- `fetchEntries`, `fetchChains`, `upsertEntries` and `insertChains` can not be static methods in a class or raw functions but should be static! You cannot put classic methods of an instance here.
- `fetchEntries`, `fetchChains`, `upsertEntries` and `insertChains` (if async) cannot access the state of the program, they will run in a separate `Isolate` with no data from the main thread (for example static/global variables populated during an initialization phase of your program will not exist). If you need to access some data from the main thread, the only way we think we'll work is to save this information inside a file or a database and read it from the callback. This pattern will slow down the `search` process. If you don't need async in the callbacks (for example the `sqlite` library has sync functions, you can call `*WrapperWithoutIsolate` and keep all the process in the same thread, so you can use your global variables).

### Implementation details

- The `search` and `upsert` methods will call the Rust FFI via native bindings synchronously. If you want to not stop your main thread, please call `compute` to run the search in a different Isolate.

## FFI libs notes

This project has been first created via:

```bash
flutter create --org com.example --template=plugin --platforms=android,ios -a kotlin cloudproof
```

### Generating Dart bindings from `cloudproof.h`

The `lib/src/generated_bindings.dart` are generated with `ffigen` with the config file `./ffigen_*.yml`:

```bash
flutter pub run ffigen --config ffigen_cloudproof.yaml
```

#### iOS WARNING

Use cbindgen, do not forget to remove `str` type in `libcloudproof_cover_crypt.h` (last two lines) for iOS to compile (type `str` unknown in C headers).

The two `.h` need to be inside the `ios/Classes` folder. Android doesn't need `.h` files.

### Building `.so`, `.a`…

#### Linux

Just copy `.so` file from the Rust projects to the `resources` folder. These `.so` are only useful to run the tests on Linux.

#### Android

Download artifacts from the Gitlab CI. You should get a `jniLibs` folder to copy to `android/src/main`.

Then:

```bash
cd example
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

#### iOS

If building with `cargo lipo` on Linux we only get `aarch64-apple-ios` and `x86_64-apple-ios`.

On codemagic.io:

- `aarch64-apple-ios` is failing with "ld: in /Users/builder/clone/ios/libcloudproof_cover_crypt.a(cover_crypt.cover_crypt.aea4b2d2-cgu.0.rcgu.o), building for iOS Simulator, but linking in object file built for iOS, file '/Users/builder/clone/ios/libcloudproof_cover_crypt.a' for architecture arm64"
- `x86_64-apple-ios` is failing with "ld: warning: ignoring file /Users/builder/clone/ios/libcloudproof_cover_crypt.a, building for iOS Simulator-arm64 but attempting to link with file built for iOS Simulator-x86_64"

To make the flutter build succeed, 3 prerequisites are needed:

- declaring headers (CoverCrypt and Findex) in CloudproofPlugin.h (concat both headers)
- call artificially 1 function of each native library in SwiftCloudproofPlugin.swift
- use universal ios build: copy both .a in `cloudproof_flutter/ios`

## Cloudproof versions Correspondence

When using local encryption and decryption with [CoverCrypt](https://github.com/Cosmian/cover_crypt) native libraries are required.

Check the main pages of the respective projects to build the native libraries appropriate for your systems. The [test directory](./src/test/resources/linux-x86-64/) provides pre-built libraries for Linux GLIBC 2.17. These libraries should run fine on a system with a more recent GLIBC version.

This table shows the minimum versions correspondences between the various components
